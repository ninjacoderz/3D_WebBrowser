## What is Deck.gl?
Deck.gl is open-source WebGL framework for visualizaing large-scale geospatial data. It's specifically designed for creating high-performance, interactive visualizations of large datasets on a map. It provides a set of pre-build layers and tools for building data-driven applications, geospatian visualization.

# Key features of Deck.gl
    Built-in support for geospatial data visualization, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and 3D terrains.
    High-performance rendering of large datasets using WebGL.
    Multiple layers for visualizing different data types, including choropleths, arcs, and paths.
    Easy integration with React, Mapbox, and Google Maps.
    
# How Does Deck.gl Differ from Three.js?

- **Purpose**:
  - **Deck.gl**: Focused on **geospatial data visualization** and **large-scale data** on 2D/3D maps.
  - **Three.js**: **General-purpose 3D rendering** for **3D models, games, simulations**, and interactive applications.

- **Geospatial Data Support**:
  - **Deck.gl**: Has **built-in support for geospatial data**, such as points, heatmaps, 3D terrain, paths.
  - **Three.js**: Does not natively support geospatial data, but can render geospatial data with custom code or external libraries.

- **Rendering Focus**:
  - **Deck.gl**: Optimized for **rendering large datasets** and high **performance** in geospatial data visualization.
  - **Three.js**: Focuses on **rendering 3D scenes**, including objects, animations, and simulations.

- **Integration with Maps**:
  - **Deck.gl**: **Direct integration with maps** (Mapbox, Google Maps) for displaying data on maps.
  - **Three.js**: Not natively integrated with maps; requires custom code for map-based rendering.

- **Ease of Use**:
  - **Deck.gl**: Provides **pre-built layers** for data visualization, easy to use for geospatial applications.
  - **Three.js**: Requires more effort to create 3D models and scenes, offering more flexibility but less abstraction.

- **Data Handling and Performance**:
  - **Deck.gl**: Optimized for handling **large datasets** (e.g., millions of data points) with efficient rendering using WebGL.
  - **Three.js**: Can handle large data, but not optimized specifically for large-scale data visualization like Deck.gl.
