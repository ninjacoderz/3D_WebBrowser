## What is Deck.gl?
Deck.gl is open-source WebGL framework for visualizaing large-scale geospatial data. It's specifically designed for creating high-performance, interactive visualizations of large datasets on a map. It provides a set of pre-build layers and tools for building data-driven applications, geospatian visualization.

# Key features of Deck.gl
    Built-in support for geospatial data visualization, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and 3D terrains.
    High-performance rendering of large datasets using WebGL.
    Multiple layers for visualizing different data types, including choropleths, arcs, and paths.
    Easy integration with React, Mapbox, and Google Maps.
# How Does Deck.gl Differ from Three.js?
    | **Criteria**                       | **Deck.gl**                                                | **Three.js**                                               |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                         | Focused on **geospatial data visualization** and **large-scale data** on 2D/3D maps. | **General-purpose 3D rendering** for **3D models, games, simulations**, and interactive applications. |
| **Geospatial Data Support**         | Has **built-in support for geospatial data**, such as points, heatmaps, 3D terrain, paths. | Does not natively support geospatial data, but can render geospatial data with custom code or external libraries. |
| **Rendering Focus**                 | Optimized for **rendering large datasets** and high **performance** in geospatial data visualization. | Focuses on **rendering 3D scenes**, including objects, animations, and simulations. |
| **Integration with Maps**           | **Direct integration with maps** (Mapbox, Google Maps) for displaying data on maps. | Not natively integrated with maps; requires custom code for map-based rendering. |
| **Ease of Use**                     | Provides **pre-built layers** for data visualization, easy to use for geospatial applications. | Requires more effort to create 3D models and scenes, offering more flexibility but less abstraction. |
| **Data Handling and Performance**   | Optimized for handling **large datasets** (e.g., millions of data points) with efficient rendering using WebGL. | Can handle large data, but not optimized specifically for large-scale data visualization like Deck.gl. |
